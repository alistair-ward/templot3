# templot3
Templot3 is an open source fork of the Templot2 program by Martin Wynne.

See README.txt for the original ReadMe by Martin.

Templot2 is still the official version of Templot. It is still under active development
and can be found at <http://templot.com>

## Goals of this fork

In no particular order, the goals for this fork are:
* create an open source, functionally equivalent version of Templot
* make templot3 compile and run across several platforms, including Win32, Win64, Linux (x86, amd64 and RPi).
* work on improving the code structure/design.
* add currently unsupported features from templot2
